Today, I checked my mail.  
The number of letters I received was between five and ten.  
I cannot tell you how many letters I received.  
At least four were letters about my local hackerspace.  
One was a postcard from a developer I sponsor.  
One was a letter from my bank.  
If there were any others, I couldn't tell you.  

I opened all the letters at home.  
They were addressed to me.  
Then I went for a short walk,  
during which I was quite calm, and not at all worried.  
I deposited four checks for the hackerspace.  
I pondered things, though I can't tell you what I was pondering.  

I then went out and bought a new cellphone.  
A "burner", they call it.  
I paid cash.  
I cannot tell you any reason for me to purchase a cellphone.  
I cannot say that I have ever used that cellphone,  
or what I would have used it for.  

I went and sat in a public park.  
It is a secluded space, few people go there.  
At the top of the hill, there is a bench.  
It is a little windy, but the view is spectacular.  
I spent several hours there.  
Wind makes it difficult to talk on the phone.  

I pondered some advice that I received.  
The days ahead may be different  
from how I yesteray imagined that they would be.  
Though I cannot tell you why.  

I do not know any secrets.  
You must know that there is nothing which I cannot say.  
I am always free to tell the truth.
