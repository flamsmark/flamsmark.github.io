**If you don't know me, the best way to get in touch is probably email.** Sometimes I can be a little slow to reply. If your message is important or you don't hear back within a day or so, please feel free to gently remind me about your message. Sending another email is fine, but a reminder sent another way is more likely to get my attention.

* Personal: [me@tomlowenthal.com][] [+GPG]({{site.url}}/id.txt)  
* CPJ: [tlowenthal@cpj.org][] [+GPG]({{site.url}}/id.txt)  


I'm much quicker to reply to a short message than a long one. For best results, send me a tweet or direct message on [Twitter][@flamsmark] or IM me on Jabber or IRC .

I think that [Pond][] is much better than email for personal correspondence. If you agree, IM me with OTR so we can set things up.



Press &c.
---------

If you're writing about a technical topic, I'm more than happy to help clarify or explain details on background. It's easier to talk about this sort of stuff over the phone; please email me to set up a time to chat.

If you need on-the-record comments from someone at CPJ, I'm only the right person for technical stuff. For anything else, you should get in touch with <info@cpj.org>. It takes me a little longer to prep for a on-the-record discussion than just to help out with technical details on background. Even if you are looking for on-the-record comments, I find that it often helps to clarify technical details on background first.

If you're a journalist or media organization and you want help protecting yourself or your staff, colleagues, readers, or sources, I'm a good person to talk to. Please get in touch as safely as needed based on the risks you face.

If you're a potential source or whistle-blower who's considering getting in touch with a journalist but want to protect your safety and privacy, I may be able to help. I'm willing and able to keep your identity completely private, but I can't erase other traces you make. Please do your best to ensure that however you get in touch, you do so as discretely as you can.



Speaking
--------

I love going to events and telling people about the things I care about.

## Crypto

If you're up to it, I'm happy to get GPG-encrypted messages. Here's a copy of all my [crypto info]({{site.url}}crypto.html), signed with me [GPG key]({{site.url}}key.asc). The copy of my key hosted on this site is just the basics. It's always best to get an updated copy from your favorite key-server. Here's what you should be looking for:
