If you want to get in touch, it's always fastest to IM me on Jabber or IRC or to send me a tweet or direct message on [Twitter][@flamsmark]. You can email me at [me@tomlowenthal.com][], but I'm often slow to reply. If your message is important, it may be useful to gently remind me by other means, or with a followup email.

I think that [Pond][] is much better than email for personal correspondence. You should contact me via IM with OTR to set exchange a secret.

Here's a text copy of all my crypto [identity]({{site.url}}/crypto.html) info, signed with my [GPG key][].

I'm a big fan of iCal formatted event invitations. If you use Google Calendar, you should send calendar invites to <flamsmark@gmail.com>, not me@tomlowenthal.com.
